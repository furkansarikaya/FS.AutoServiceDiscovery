# System Architecture Guide

This comprehensive guide explores the architectural design and structure of FS.AutoServiceDiscovery.Extensions, explaining how all components work together to provide efficient, scalable service discovery.

## 🏗️ Overview

The FS.AutoServiceDiscovery.Extensions library is built on a sophisticated, modular architecture that follows modern software design principles. Think of it as a well-orchestrated symphony where each component has a specific role, but they all work together harmoniously to create beautiful music - in this case, seamless service discovery.

The architecture is designed around several key principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Open/Closed Principle**: The system is open for extension but closed for modification
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class and interface has one reason to change
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients aren't forced to depend on interfaces they don't use

### Discovery Engine

The Discovery Engine serves as the central orchestrator of the entire discovery process. It coordinates all other components and manages the flow of information through the system.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Coordinating assembly scanning operations
- Managing the plugin execution lifecycle
- Orchestrating conditional evaluation
- Integrating performance monitoring
- Consolidating results from all discovery sources

**Implementation Pattern:**
The engine follows the Coordinator pattern, where it doesn't perform the actual work but delegates to specialized components while managing their interactions.

### Assembly Scanner

The Assembly Scanner is responsible for examining .NET assemblies and identifying types that are candidates for service registration.

**Architecture Features:**
- **Parallel Processing**: Scans multiple assemblies concurrently for improved performance
- **Smart Filtering**: Early elimination of obviously non-service types
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of problematic assemblies
- **Metadata Caching**: Avoids repeated reflection operations

**Performance Optimizations:**
```csharp
// Layered filtering approach for maximum efficiency
public class OptimizedTypeScanner
{
    // Layer 1: Quick assembly-level filter
    private bool CouldContainServices(Assembly assembly);
    
    // Layer 2: Fast type filtering (minimal reflection)
    private bool FastTypeFilter(Type type);
    
    // Layer 3: Detailed examination (expensive operations)
    private bool DetailedTypeFilter(Type type);
}
```

### Convention Resolver

The Convention Resolver implements the strategy pattern to apply different naming conventions for service type resolution.

**Architectural Benefits:**
- **Extensibility**: New conventions can be added without modifying existing code
- **Priority Ordering**: Conventions are evaluated in configurable order
- **Performance Tracking**: Each convention's effectiveness is monitored
- **Caching**: Results are cached to avoid repeated resolution

## 🔌 Plugin Architecture

The plugin system extends the core discovery capabilities with a sophisticated architecture that maintains isolation while enabling powerful integrations.

### Plugin Lifecycle

```mermaid

    participant Engine as Discovery Engine
    participant Coordinator as Plugin Coordinator
    participant Plugin as Service Plugin
    participant Validator as Plugin Validator
    
    Engine->>Coordinator: ExecutePlugins()
    Coordinator->>Plugin: CanProcessAssembly()
    Plugin->>Coordinator: true/false
    
    alt Plugin can process assembly
        Coordinator->>Plugin: DiscoverServices()
        Plugin->>Coordinator: ServiceRegistrationInfo[]
        Coordinator->>Plugin: ValidateDiscoveredServices()
        Plugin->>Validator: PluginValidationResult
        Validator->>Coordinator: Validation Results
    end
    
    Coordinator->>Engine: PluginExecutionResult
```

### Plugin Isolation

Each plugin operates in isolation to prevent cross-contamination:

**Error Isolation**: Plugin failures don't crash the discovery process
**Resource Isolation**: Plugins can't interfere with each other's resources
**Performance Isolation**: Slow plugins don't block others
**Dependency Isolation**: Plugins have their own dependency injection scope

## 🚀 Performance Architecture

The performance architecture implements multiple layers of optimization to ensure scalable operation.

### Caching Strategy

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Request] --> B{Assembly Cache}
    B -->|Hit| C[Cached Results]
    B -->|Miss| D[Type Scanner]
    D --> E{Type Metadata Cache}
    E -->|Hit| F[Cached Metadata]
    E -->|Miss| G[Reflection Operations]
    G --> H[Cache Results]
    H --> I[Return Results]
    F --> I
    C --> I
    
    style C fill:#e8f5e9
    style F fill:#e8f5e9
    style G fill:#ffebee
```

**Multi-Level Caching:**
1. **Assembly Level**: Complete discovery results cached per assembly
2. **Type Level**: Individual type metadata cached
3. **Convention Level**: Service resolution results cached
4. **Expression Level**: Conditional evaluation results cached

### Parallel Processing

The system uses intelligent parallel processing strategies:

**Assembly Parallelism**: Multiple assemblies processed concurrently
**Type Parallelism**: Types within assemblies processed in parallel
**Plugin Parallelism**: Independent plugins executed concurrently
**Adaptive Scaling**: Parallelism adjusted based on workload

## 🔧 Configuration Architecture

The configuration system provides flexible, type-safe options management with multiple configuration sources.

### Configuration Hierarchy

```mermaid

    A[AutoServiceOptions] --> B[Basic Settings]
    A --> C[Performance Settings]
    A --> D[Plugin Settings]
    A --> E[Conditional Settings]
    
    B --> F[Profile]
    B --> G[Logging]
    B --> H[Test Environment]
    
    C --> I[Caching]
    C --> J[Parallel Processing]
    C --> K[Metrics Collection]
    
    D --> L[Plugin Types]
    D --> M[Plugin Instances]
    D --> N[Plugin Priorities]
    
    E --> O[Configuration Context]
    E --> P[Expression Evaluator]
    E --> Q[Feature Flags]
```

### Fluent Configuration

The fluent configuration API provides a domain-specific language for complex configurations:

```csharp
services.ConfigureAutoServices()
    .FromCurrentDomain(assembly => !assembly.FullName.StartsWith("System"))
    .WithProfile(ctx => ctx.Environment.IsProduction() ? "Prod" : "Dev")
    .When(ctx => ctx.FeatureEnabled("AutoDiscovery"))
    .ExcludeNamespaces("*.Internal.*", "*.Tests.*")
    .WithPerformanceOptimizations()
    .Apply();
```

## 🔍 Conditional Architecture

The conditional registration system provides sophisticated logic evaluation with compile-time safety.

### Expression Evaluation Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Service Type] --> B[Conditional Attributes]
    B --> C[Expression Parser]
    C --> D[Context Builder]
    D --> E[Expression Evaluator]
    E --> F[Boolean Result]
    F --> G{Should Register?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Register Service]
    G -->|No| I[Skip Service]
    
    style H fill:#e8f5e9
    style I fill:#ffebee
```

**Context Architecture:**
- **Environment Context**: Type-safe environment information
- **Configuration Context**: Strongly-typed configuration access
- **Feature Flag Context**: Dynamic feature evaluation
- **Custom Context**: Application-specific extensions

## 📊 Monitoring Architecture

Comprehensive monitoring provides observability into every aspect of the discovery process.

### Metrics Collection

```mermaid

    A[Discovery Operations] --> B[Metrics Collector]
    B --> C[Assembly Metrics]
    B --> D[Cache Metrics]
    B --> E[Plugin Metrics]
    B --> F[Performance Metrics]
    
    C --> G[Metrics Aggregator]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[Statistics Summary]
    G --> I[Performance Report]
    G --> J[Health Dashboard]
    
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style G fill:#e8f5e9
```

**Monitoring Levels:**
1. **Operation Level**: Individual discovery operations
2. **Component Level**: Assembly scanning, plugin execution, etc.
3. **System Level**: Overall performance and health
4. **Business Level**: Service registration trends and patterns

## 🏛️ Architectural Patterns
